Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound “Lub Dub”.","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"heart-introduction","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":"2013-07-13T00:08:13Z","render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/heart-introduction","extended_slug":"science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/heart-introduction","slug":"heart-introduction","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"title":"Heart introduction","sha":"209712ce0699008044f5e00a7bdc2f106735c529","standalone_title":"Heart Introduction","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"209712ce0699008044f5e00a7bdc2f106735c529","content_id":"xd01a851d","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"science","relative_url":"/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/blood-vessels","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/blood-vessels","translated_standalone_title":"Blood Vessels","translated_title":"Blood vessels","gplus_url":"","id":"xb9efce3a","old_key_name":"Rsw1eYo9h1dTjmvk1GdmvIeK7Z6-XLbzUcIp3ghU","hide":false,"title":"Blood vessels","child_data":[{"kind":"Video","id":23990},{"kind":"Video","id":1036157588},{"kind":"Video","id":1036278079},{"kind":"Video","id":"x7ac317cf"},{"kind":"Video","id":"x6451892a"},{"kind":"Video","id":"x02c66e8b"}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"Where does your blood go after it leaves the heart?

Check out the videos to learn more about how the nerves help to regulate the heart.","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"nerve-regulation-of-the-heart","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":"2013-07-13T00:08:13Z","render_type":"UncuratedTutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/nerve-regulation-of-the-heart","extended_slug":"science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/nerve-regulation-of-the-heart","slug":"nerve-regulation-of-the-heart","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"sha":"6897bf343585398192454a79b34630914631708e","standalone_title":"Nerve Regulation of the Heart","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"6897bf343585398192454a79b34630914631708e","content_id":"x4d0eb449","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"science","relative_url":"/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/preload-and-afterload","creation_date":"2014-04-18T15:00:30Z","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/circulatory-system/preload-and-afterload","translated_standalone_title":"Preload and Afterload","translated_title":"Preload and afterload","gplus_url":"","id":"x8c6b9867","old_key_name":"POuy-n4nvLJpD3-VTuIgm0CpnFLQBZ0Ru3zxrZO5","hide":false,"title":"Preload and afterload","child_data":[{"kind":"Video","id":1117437512},{"kind":"Video","id":1133168259},{"kind":"Video","id":1150515528},{"kind":"Video","id":1150565196},{"kind":"Video","id":1150572205},{"kind":"Video","id":1150353015},{"kind":"Video","id":1150546387},{"kind":"Video","id":1150537387},{"kind":"Video","id":1159114411}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"After using your jeans for a while, you’ll begin to notice small tears and rips developing in the fabric.

In the 14th Century, Siena was an independent nation and often at war with its neighbor, Florence. Some of the most important art of the 14th Century was commissioned for Siena’s Cathedral and town hall.

American artists looked to England for support and inspiration, often to the older Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was the painter to the King, and first President of the Royal Academy in London.","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"english-portraiture","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":"2013-09-02T03:49:32Z","render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/english-portraiture","extended_slug":"humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/english-portraiture","slug":"english-portraiture","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"title":"Britain & America in the Age of Revolution","sha":"543a2882ed091130f5c00aac7e305601eb362737","standalone_title":"Art History: English Portraiture","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"543a2882ed091130f5c00aac7e305601eb362737","content_id":"xef336b54","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"humanities","relative_url":"/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/Colonial-Americas","creation_date":"2014-04-10T14:49:26Z","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/Colonial-Americas","translated_standalone_title":"Colonial Americas","translated_title":"Colonial Americas","gplus_url":"","id":"x43a90310","old_key_name":null,"hide":false,"title":"Colonial Americas","child_data":[{"kind":"Video","id":"x0ce01d2d"},{"kind":"Article","id":"xfb27759c"}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"Art and culture from the European invasion of the Americas to the end of the colonial era.","version":null,"alternate_slugs":[],"deleted_mod_time":null,"logo_image_url":"","in_knowledge_map":false,"description":"Art and culture from the European invasion of the Americas to the end of the colonial era.","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"Colonial-Americas","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":null,"render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/Colonial-Americas","extended_slug":"humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/Colonial-Americas","slug":"Colonial-Americas","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"sha":"699ab2b5c10053b43791ab5f93061ab136532245","standalone_title":"Colonial Americas","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"699ab2b5c10053b43791ab5f93061ab136532245","content_id":"x43a90310","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"humanities","relative_url":"/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/africa-1700s","creation_date":"2014-07-04T12:57:02Z","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/africa-1700s","translated_standalone_title":"Africa","translated_title":"Africa","author_key":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJPCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiQXVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9nb29nbGVpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvMTE1NDcyMjkwMTg1Mzc4NDcyNTQzDA","gplus_url":"","id":"x421d41bf","old_key_name":null,"hide":false,"do_not_publish":false,"child_data":[{"kind":"Article","id":"xa5df54bf"},{"kind":"Exercise","id":"xc845aa15"}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"Great change took place during this period throughout Africa.

Etruscan art, by contrast, is illuminated primarily by modern archaeological record and by descriptions of contemporary external observers.\n\nBy permission, © 2013 The College Board","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"greece-etruria-rome","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":null,"render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/greece-etruria-rome","extended_slug":"test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/greece-etruria-rome","slug":"greece-etruria-rome","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"title":"Ancient Greece","sha":"9cef92cd937dcc4f44f02673c7b917333b63cf0f","standalone_title":"Ancient Greece","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"9cef92cd937dcc4f44f02673c7b917333b63cf0f","content_id":"x6f6edb84","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"test-prep","relative_url":"/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-etruria","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-etruria","translated_standalone_title":"Ancient Etruria","translated_title":"Ancient Etruria","gplus_url":"","id":"x2fbf8a5a","old_key_name":null,"hide":false,"title":"Ancient Etruria","child_data":[{"kind":"Article","id":"x77d56b38"},{"kind":"Article","id":"x4093b128"},{"kind":"Article","id":"x9b381c3a"}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"","version":null,"alternate_slugs":[],"deleted_mod_time":null,"logo_image_url":"","in_knowledge_map":false,"description":"","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"AP-ancient-etruria","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":null,"render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-etruria","extended_slug":"test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-etruria","slug":"AP-ancient-etruria","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"sha":"e672ae82eab56b3ba8fbc5186bd72cbd36f55df7","standalone_title":"Ancient Etruria","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"e672ae82eab56b3ba8fbc5186bd72cbd36f55df7","content_kind":"Topic"},{"icon_src":"","domain_slug":"test-prep","relative_url":"/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-rome","creation_date":"2014-06-23T14:54:45Z","web_url":"","ka_url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-rome","translated_standalone_title":"Ancient Rome","translated_title":"Ancient Rome","author_key":"ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJPCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiQXVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9nb29nbGVpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvMTE1NDcyMjkwMTg1Mzc4NDcyNTQzDA","gplus_url":"","id":"x26909f88","old_key_name":null,"hide":false,"do_not_publish":false,"child_data":[{"kind":"Video","id":785318223},{"kind":"Video","id":1159741561},{"kind":"Video","id":1315102373},{"kind":"Video","id":903658510},{"kind":"Article","id":"x526a4643"},{"kind":"Video","id":671422821},{"kind":"Video","id":671397702},{"kind":"Video","id":671563202},{"kind":"Video","id":1250456711}],"children":[],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"","version":null,"alternate_slugs":[],"deleted_mod_time":null,"logo_image_url":"","in_knowledge_map":false,"description":"","x_pos":0,"node_slug":"AP-ancient-rome","deleted":false,"listed_locales":[],"facebook_url":"","backup_timestamp":null,"render_type":"Tutorial","background_image_url":"","background_image_caption":"","topic_page_url":"/test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-rome","extended_slug":"test-prep/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-AP/AP-ancient-rome","slug":"AP-ancient-rome","tags":[],"kind":"Topic","in_topic_browser":false,"title":"Ancient Rome","sha":"02512b5d2a1f3d15f9276838d14177964829fcde","standalone_title":"Ancient Rome","y_pos":0,"current_revision_key":"02512b5d2a1f3d15f9276838d14177964829fcde","content_id":"x26909f88","content_kind":"Topic"}],"twitter_url":"","translated_description":"Artistic traditions of the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt focused on representing royal figures and divinities and on the function of funerary and palatial complexes within their cultural contexts.
